# Matching bolts and nuts
We are given an array of bolts and an array of nuts (it's known, that every nut from array matches at least to one bolt form array). We cannot compare a bolt with another bolt or a nut with another nut, but we can compare nut with bolt. The task is to match all bolt-nut pairs in a time *O(nlogn)*
